<h1>Welcome To The Billionare World: Data Visual analysis to learn some new facts about the world's richest.</h1>
<h3>Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak where people are receiving stimulus checks at one end for the daily survival, we have one sector of humanity contributing to this give and take relation. This got me thinking about should billionaires even exist?  There has been a much-heated debate on this topic in the USA and UK where Bernie Sanders says billionaires should be taxed out of existence while Joe Biden has warned against demonizing rich people.
<p>A new report suggested the world’s 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than 4.6 billion people, underscoring the degree of global inequality. <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/time-care?cid=aff_affwd_donate_id78888&awc=5991_1588560295_e499666771e54514c43d76e0fb835a3a"> (Oxfam International study) </a>. Other experimental studies showed that in 1990, the total wealth of all US billionaires was $118 billion in today's dollars. Last year, it grew to over $3 trillion. The three of today’s billionaires: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet inherit the wealth as the bottom half of the US households combined. On the other hand, about one-fifth of Americans have zero negative worth and about two-fifth of them don’t even have cash of $400 emergency at hand. <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/time-care?cid=aff_affwd_donate_id78888&awc=5991_1588560295_e499666771e54514c43d76e0fb835a3a"> (Federal Reserve Report) </a> </h3>
<h3>All of this got me interested in the dataset about these <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/billionaires/">billionaires</a> compiled by few researchers at <a href="http://www.iie.com/publications/interstitial.cfm?ResearchID=2917">Peterson Institute for International Economics</a> from Forbes World’s Billionaires lists from 1996-2014.</h3>
<h4>In this digital age we have become more aware about the trends and paterns occuring in our dailylifestyle. We have visuals embedded in our daily routines so much that we forget to stop and think about how is data involded in this. For example we watch sci-fie movies displaying stat of a robot in the fide on a blue  hue screen in the air, or games score on TV giving the stats of the players and recods of the matches, smart watches monitering our pulses and displaying the data. You name it and we have it. So in this report I have tried to use such data visualization techniques to answer a few questions to crave my curiosity about the world's richest. I have included few representations which inspired my analysis and added dimension to my findings. So lets get started and find obtain some insights based on the data we have.</h4>
